Docker Compose
-------------------------------

What is Docker Compose?
Ans:
Instead of writing multiple docker build and docker run commands, ---> One configuration file + Orchestration Commands (build,start,stop..etc)

Docker compose does not replace Dockerfiles for custom images. 
Docker compose does not replace Images or containers. 
Docker compose is not suited for managing multiple containers on different hosts (machines)

Writing Docker Compose files--> 
Services(Containers)
	Published Ports 
	Environment Variables
	Volumes 
	Networks
	

------------------------------------------------------
Creating a Compose File
------------------------------------------------------

Create docker-compose.yaml file 

version: "3.8"
services: 
  mongodb:
    image: "mongo"
    volumes:
      - data:/data/db
    environement:
      # MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: max
      # MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret  
    env_file:
      - ./env/mongo.env		(Containing environment variables)
  # backend:
  # frontend: 

volumes:
  data:
  
 
 
 Now, navigate the folder in which our docker-compose file is present:-
 docker-compose up	
 You will be in attached mode. 
 ctrl+c	(Now, the container will stop)
 docker-compose up -d
 
 docker-compose down		(It will delete everything and shut them down)	(It does not delete the volume though)
 
 
 
Now, for backend-->
