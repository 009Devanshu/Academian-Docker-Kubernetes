Sharing Images (Pull/Push) concepts
------------------- --------------------------------------------

We can share Dockerfile along with code or Image. 

---------------------------------------
Pushing Images to Dockerhub
---------------------------------------

We can share images via Docker Hub or Private Registry

Pushing Image to Dockerhub 
Create account on hub.docker.com
I loggen in using devanshu.official09@gmail.com 
I used username--> devanshu98
I used password--> deepthemazic12
devanshu98 will be your name space 
Now, create a new repository. Let's say 'node-hello-world'

To push new tag to this repository---> 
docker push devanshu98/node-hello-world:tagname		(If we run this command directly in our local environment, It will give error, our local environment should know about this 
							repository first)
							Error: The push refers to repository [docker.io/devanshu98/node-hello-world] An image does not exist locally with the tag:
							devanshu98/node-hello-world

We will have to our image the name devanshu98/node-hello-world

There are two ways, either we can create another image or we can rename the image. 
	Creating the image	
		docker build -t devanshu98/node-hello-world .
	Renaming the image
		docker tag old_name new_name
		docker tag node-app:latest devanshu98/node-hello-world		(However, old image will also be existed)(This new image will be clone of old_image with same id)
			You can also give tag--> docker tag node-app:latest devanshu98/node-hello-world:latest		(But, I did not give tagname to our new image)

Now, push the image
	docker push devanshu98/node-hello-world		(But, access denied hahaha!!!)
So, provide login from our local environment
	docker login				(And provide username and password)
			
			
Note: If you want to logout
	docker logout



------------------------------------------------------------
Pulling and Using Shared Images
------------------------------------------------------------


Pulling docker image from docker hub. No need to login(Since it is public)	
docker pull image_name
	docker pull devanshu98/node-hello-world:latest
	
Important Notes:
'docker pull...' will always fetch the latest image from your container registry.
If you run 'docker run...', first, it will look for the image in your local machine. If it is not there, i will pull the latest image from the docker registry.
	If you already have the image locally, then if you run the container again, it will not check the image on your system, a latest one or not. So, that's why you will need to 
	run 'docker pull..' in order to make sure that you have latest image.
